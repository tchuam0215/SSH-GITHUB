This repo is a test, on how to share your local git repo/project with github : 
1. Create an ssh key. 
2. share the public key with github.
3. Then do a git init to initialize the repository as a git repository.
4. Push the local repo with changes to github via ssh. 
5. do some git command (status log commit and check the changes to the remote repo).
